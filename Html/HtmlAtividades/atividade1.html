        Her beauty's crazy <br />
        I watch her from the crowd <br />
        Her voice is so amazing <br />
        She make her momma proud <br />
        I tried to send her flowers <br />
        But she has no address <br />
        Her home is in my heart <br />
        It's like she never left <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        This is more than a crush <br />
        More than a like like more than a love <br />
        Baby I'ma make you mine <br />
        And I ain't giving up <br />
      </p>

        'Cause I'm not giving up on you <br />
        Don't run away <br />
        Don't run away from the truth <br />
        'Cause I'm not giving up on you <br />
